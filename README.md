📌 Factor-Based Portfolio Optimization

A Multi-Factor Approach to Portfolio Management using the Fama-French Three-Factor Model

📊 Project Overview
This project explores factor-based investing using the Fama-French Three-Factor Model. It aims to construct a portfolio optimized for risk-adjusted returns.
Key Features:
1. Portfolio optimization using Market (MKT), Size (SMB), and Value (HML) factors.
2. Implementing linear regression to estimate factor loadings.
3. Optimizing Sharpe Ratio while applying real-world constraints.
4. Analyzing historical performance and factor exposures.

🔬 Research & Methodology

Selected 10 diverse stocks: AAPL, NVDA, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA, BRK-B, JNJ, JPM, V, PG.

Time period analyzed: 2010-2023.

Factor Calculation:

Market (MKT): Excess return of S&P 500 over the risk-free rate.

Size (SMB): Return difference between small and big stocks.

Value (HML): Return difference between high and low book-to-market stocks.

Optimization Approach:

Maximize Sharpe Ratio.

Initial constraints: Weights sum to 1.

Enhanced constraints: Maximum stock/industry weights, transaction costs.

📈 Key Insights

1. The initial efficient frontier resulted in highly concentrated portfolio weights.
2. Adding constraints improved diversification and risk-adjusted returns.
3. The optimized portfolio maintained strong factor exposures.
4. Regular rebalancing is necessary due to the dynamic nature of factor performances.

🔮 Future Work

1. Incorporate additional factors (e.g., momentum, quality).
2. Explore machine learning techniques for factor identification.
3. Investigate the impact of economic conditions on factor performance.
